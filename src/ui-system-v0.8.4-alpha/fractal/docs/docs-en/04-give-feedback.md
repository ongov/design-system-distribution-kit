title: Tell us what you think of the design system
label: Give feedback
---
The design system team has created this resource for you – and we need your input to help grow and shape it into exactly what you need.

There are two ways you can tell us what you think:

 1. Take the [2-minute design system feedback survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe45wa5cO4tBx-w9YeB9pzdDuNpPHZ90X11jG7tmW31L1lZXA/formResponse) – it will help us learn more about how you use the system and what you want to see next
 2.  [Send the design system team an email](mailto:design.system@ontario.ca) with feedback on the system or a particular element, to ask questions or to just say hi!
