## Using the design system

The design system is currently in alpha. We will be adding more elements as they are developed.

Begin with the [Getting started]({{path './docs/documentation/getting-started.html'}}) page or browse the system using the tabs on the left. For each of the basics and components, you will find:
* guidance on using the elements
* draft code in:
  * html
  * css
  * scss
  
</div>
<div class="ontario-columns ontario-medium-12 ontario-large-6">

## Our vision

The design system is an <abbr title="Ontario Public Service">OPS</abbr> community-driven collaborative product that provides an up-to-date, easy-to-use, and robust repository to share:
* foundational assets and elements
* styles
* components
* patterns

With everything in one place, the design system will empower and enable <abbr title="Ontario Public Service">OPS</abbr> staff to create accessible, consistent and user-centred digital products and services.
